# README

For my first discord chatbot

Utlizing discord.js and discord.js-commando

One of the functions was outputting navy copypasta. I deleted it to make it more formal


## Self Notes

discord.js-commando is an extension and framework for discord.js

Essentially, each command feature is in the commands folder structure


## TODO/Roadmap

* Clean up MTG search feature
* Think of any features that would be considered useful to use on daily basis
